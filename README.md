# Predator

Course project of WSM(Web Search and Mining).

## Introduction

We are asked to crawl Baidu Baike and Baidu Zhidao data, and based on these data, we build inverted index to perform user queries efficiently.  The detailed version can refer to [report](./report/wsm.pdf).

## Usage

enter the *engine* folder, run `python index.py` to build index, run `python server.py` to launch the server, and then open `localhost:3003` to enter queries.

## Ack

Thanks a lot to my teammates, Yinchu Wu and Peilin Wu.
